Dualmontile layout for dwm

'dualmontile' is a dwm layout that is similar to the default 'tile' layout.
The important difference is that this layout expands over 2 monitors.

The layout uses the currently selected monitor as the master area
and automatically finds a second monitor to use as the stack area.  
The two monitors do not need to have the same size, orientation,
y-coordinates or anything similar.

The variable 'nmaster' is still relevant for this layout, however
'mfact' becomes irrelevant.
